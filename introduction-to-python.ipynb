        "This notebook presents a very brief overview of the Python programming language, with a particular slant on tools and applications relevant for data science. It's assumed that the reader has at least a little bit of prior programming experience; the emphasis is primarily on (a) demonstrating how basic things are done in Python, and (b) reviewing the many strengths of Python (and okay, also a few weaknesses). This notebook was forked from [Tal Yarkoni's teaching materials](https://github.com/neurohackademy/introduction-to-python), and has been adapted for this course. Tal's talk is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1QZU-ZPOm0) and is 1 hour long if you are looking for a more in-depth walk through video of the code."
